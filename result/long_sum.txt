 

The case involves Hami Qutami, who was sentenced to 4 years 5 months and 21 days imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 months and 21 days for soliciting to murder. The Crown appealed the sentence, arguing that it was inadequate. The Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the appeal in part, setting aside the original non-parole period and fixing a new non-parole period of 29 months and 21 days, commencing on 8th March 2001 and ending on 28th August 2003.

The case background involves a family conflict over a daughter's relationship with a man from a different religious background. The daughter, Ruba Qutami, left home due to her family's disapproval of her relationship and eventually took out an Apprehended Violence Order against her father, mother, and husband. The prisoner, Hami Qutami, made a sarcastic and insincere comment to Ruba outside the Court Registry, showing a lack of remorse for his actions.

The Court considered the role of restoration of community harmony, the desirability of a prisoner giving evidence, and the limited weight to be given to untested, self-serving statements made to experts. The Court also referred to the Crimes Act, Sentencing Act 1989, and the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in its decision.</s>
