The judges thought about many things when deciding the length of his punishment, including his help with police officers, his past, and his current health. Even though Qutami asked for a lighter sentence of about five years, the court decided that this punishment wouldn't fit the crime he committed.

The government argued that reducing the time before parole was wrong and wanted to keep the original long period on parole. However, Qutami believed his sentence was correct and balanced the seriousness of his actions and the special circumstances of his situation. He also stated that the court should not intervene without strong evidence, and that parts of his argument might be considered twice, causing unfairness.

Finally, the court decided that while Qutami's initial sentence was too short, it wasn't so unfair that it needed changing. They noted that the judge considered everything carefully and gave each factor proper importance. Despite receiving a nice reduction for admitting guilt, the judge's method for dealing with the period until parole was controversial.
